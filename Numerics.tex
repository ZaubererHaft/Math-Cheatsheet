\section{ODEs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item linear, nonlinear, homogen, inhomogeneous
	\item analytical solutions
	\item Population models, oscillators
	\item Stable solutions
	\item Direction field, phase plots
\end{itemize}


\section{PDE}

\begin{itemize}
	\item time-dependent PDE: we have a dependency on the time derivative: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = ...$
	\item stationary PDE: PDE is not dependent on time derivative but to a function 
	\item equilibrium solution of stationary PDE: function is equal to 0
	\item initial value problem: time-dependent differential equation with given $u(t=0)$
	\item boundary value problem: no time dependency, values on boundaries given
	\item classes of boundary conditions: Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin/Mixed
	\item initial boundary problem: both starting value and values at boundaries given
	\item spacing, mesh size: height(s) of grid discretizing domain
	\item Heat equation vs. poisson equation
	\item Laplace operator
\end{itemize}

\section{Numerical approaches}
\begin{itemize}
	\item forward difference
	\item backward difference
	\item central difference 
	\item stiffness matrix
	\item implicit/explicit methods
	\item visualization: stepping vs integration
	\item stability of an differential equation
\end{itemize}
